    "bitcoin-zero-summary": "In short, Bitcoin Zero is designed to bring zk-SNARK (Zero-Knowledge Suc-cinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) back to Bitcoin. The journey of ’zero’ started from zerocoin (Miers et al., 2013) a cryptographic extension to Bitcoin including utilizing non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs; Then, zero-cash (Sasson et al., 2014) formulated and constructed decentralized anonymous payment schemes. After a few technical modification https://github.com/zcash/zips/raw/master/protocol/protocol.pdf, Zcash as an implementa-tion of zerocash has finally been available for general use. Now that zk-SNARK is widely accepted, Ethereum for example, users of Bitcoin may want to enjoy the same protection too. So, here comes the Bitcoin Zero. To achieve such a goal, addition to zk-SNARK, BCZ implemented a chainstate snapshot anda merged mining PoW."
